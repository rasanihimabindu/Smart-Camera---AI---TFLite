**Smart Camera AI using TensorFlow Lite**
A real-time object detection system that simulates an embedded AI-powered smart camera using TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV,
suitable for IoT, robotics, and edge computing applications.

**Project Aim**
This project aims to replicate a smart vision system commonly used in embedded devices like Raspberry Pi,
ESP32-CAM, or Jetson Nano. It uses a lightweight .tflite model to detect and label multiple objects in real time via webcam, mimicking low-power AI deployment.

**Features**
1. Real-time webcam-based object detection
2. Uses pre-trained MobileNet SSD (TensorFlow Lite)
3. Lightweight and fast — simulates embedded systems
4. Easy to integrate with Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, etc.
5. No cloud required — runs entirely offline
   
**Requirements**
Install required Python libraries:

pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy

**Use Cases**
1. Smart surveillance systems

2. Traffic monitoring & vehicle detection

3. Edge AI development on Raspberry Pi / Jetson

4. Object-aware robotics and drones

5. Low-power, offline IoT devices

6. Learning Objectives

**How to use TensorFlow Lite models**

1.Real-time vision using OpenCV

2.Basics of embedded-AI simulation

3.Efficient object detection without cloud

**Future Scope**

1.Integrate with Raspberry Pi GPIO for smart automation

2.Add cloud connectivity (Firebase, AWS)

3.Extend to facial recognition or license plate reading

**Developed For**
